## Description

{This application shows you the type of the triangle based on your inputs.If all your dimensions are equal then it displays an Equilateral Triangle,an isosceles triangle, two sides are exactly equal.For a scalene triangle, none of the sides is equal. However, the sum of any two sides of the triangle must be greater than the third side.Most importantly, if the sum of any two sides of the triangle is equal to or less than the third remaining side, then a triangle CANNOT be formed using those values. (For example, the values 9,4 & 3 cannot form a triangle.)  }

##Behavior Driven Development

| Behavior :      | Input | Output example |
| :--- |    :----: |  ---: |
| These dimensions cannot form a triangle| 0,0,0| The numbers you entered are either less than or Equals to Zero or are not Numbers   |
| These dimensions cannot be null| " "," "," "| The numbers you entered are either less than or Equals to Zero or are not Numbers|
| These dimensions form an Equilateral Triangle| 9,9,9 | This is an Equilateral Triangle Since All The Dimensions Are Equal|
| These dimensions cannot form a triangle|9,4,3|This is not a triangle|
|These dimensions form an isosceles triangle| 8,6,8| This is an Isosceles Triangle Since Two Dimensions Are Equal|
| These dimensions form a scalene triangle| 8,7,9| This is a scalene Triangle Since all Dimensions Are not Equal|
